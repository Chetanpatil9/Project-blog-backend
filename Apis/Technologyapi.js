As per the previous version of this policy, employees were paid EPB on a monthly basis. Under the new policy, EPB would only be paid on a quarterly basis. Moreover, employees on the bench would not be eligible to receive EPB, which would in turn reduce their monthly salary.",

To support employees during the pandemic, the company made a policy exception and paid 100% EPB irrespective of performance. Post-pandemic, the company is reverting to the original policy. This has been communicated to our employees."
